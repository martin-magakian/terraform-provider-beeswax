Required:

- `object_type` (String) The name of the resource, e.g. "advertiser" (note, these are singular)
- `permission` (Number) 4-bit integer determining Read (1), Create (2), Update (4) and Delete (8) rights for the resource. If a Permission is set to 1, the Role can only Read that type of object.
