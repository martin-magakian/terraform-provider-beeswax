### Nested Schema for `permissions`

Read-Only:

- `object_type` (String) The name of the resource, e.g. "advertiser" (note, these are singular)
- `permission` (Number) 4-bit integer determining Read (1), Create (2), Update (4) and Delete (8) rights for the resource. If a Permission is set to 1, the Role can only Read that type of object. If set to 3, the Role can Read and Create the object (1+2). When a Permission is set to 15 the Role has full rights to the object (1+2+4+8), if set to zero the Role has no rights.
